# Quantum VAE

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the idea of utizlizing quantum computing capabilities of the Qiskit library to train a variational autoencoder (VAE) on a [cat pictures dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/cat-dataset).

We did not manage to achive great results in terms of generations, but using Qiskit as a random number generator has proven to be a viable idea.
